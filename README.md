# Sandbox AWS Infrastructure as Code

The current project focuses on comparing the functionality, flexibility, and usability of two of the most widely used tools in infrastructure creation:

- **CloudFormation**
- **Terraform**

## The Projects

Each project will be organized in its own directory, containing all the necessary files to create specific infrastructures in AWS. The scope of these projects includes:

- **Basic Resource Creation:** Setting up fundamental resources.
- **Networking:** Configuring network components and architectures.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Deploying and managing serverless applications.
- **Database Deployment:** Setting up and managing databases.
- **Scaling and Load Balancing:** Implementing strategies for scaling and load distribution.
- **Complex Workflows:** Managing intricate and multi-step workflows.
- **Cross-Provider Deployment:** Deploying resources across multiple cloud providers.
- **State Management and Versioning:** Managing infrastructure state and version control.
- **Cost Management:** Monitoring and optimizing cloud costs.
- **Security and Compliance:** Ensuring infrastructure security and adherence to compliance standards.

This structured approach will allow for a comprehensive comparison of both tools across a variety of real-world scenarios.

## Iterations

Each project will undergo multiple iterations. The **initial milestone** will establish a **baseline setup** that functions correctly. **Subsequent iterations** will focus on enhancing:

- **Security:** Implementing robust security measures.
- **Variable Management:** Efficiently handling configuration variables.
- **Reusability:** Ensuring components can be reused across different projects.
- **Portability:** Making the infrastructure easily transferable between environments.
- **Single Purpose Architecture:** Designing architectures with clear, single-purpose components.
- **Other Paradigms:** Incorporating additional best practices and design principles.

This README file will be continuously updated to improve readability and provide objective details about each project.

## Versioning

Each project has its own README and CHANGELOG files for easy followup on changes and updates. Look for specific versioning information in each project's directory.
